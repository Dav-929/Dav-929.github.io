### CPSC 120

* Lab 08

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I was always curious about how the
    game Blackjack works. I was able to write functions for the first time
    that calculate the correct value of a Blackjack hand no matter how many
    Aces were dealt. It's great that I learned to play blackjack.
