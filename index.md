### CPSC 120

* Lab 08
        Lab 8, part 1. was one of my faviote labs. In this lab we learned how to make sentences while just filling in the blanks. It was very nice to see the many different kinds of combinations that we were able to use to fill in the blanks. Using this is very cool because you're able to make a different combination for different sentences.

* Lab 09
        Lab 9, part 1. In this lab we learned how to find the average of scores. This was really nice to learn because using this you're also able to calculate the average of many different situations. We were able to use it to drop the lowest number and highest number, then divide them and be able to get the average. 

* Lab 10
        Lab 10, part 2. This lab was very cool. It was pretty cool to see how the whole system comes together. With being able to find the population for each county. Just by going through some rows and columns and finding the corresponding match for each of them.
